## Database Tree and Context Menus

The tree on the left side of workspace displays the objects inside a server once a database session is established.   

Most of tree items have a context menu with a list of actions available for item. The context menu can be accessed by right-clicking on the tree node.

![Tree context menu when right-clicking on an object](./images/context_menu.png)

> üí° The properties of currently selected DB object and it's SQL definition are shown in  **Properties/DDL** tabs at the bottom of DB object tree

## Database Operation Tabs

The area to the right of the Database Tree contains the operation tabs. There are multiple kinds of tabs, the most common are:
  - Query - used to edit and execute queries against the database, view and export query results and analyze query performance.
  - Database Console - shows a command line-like interface for the database
  - Monitoring Dashboard - displays various performance metrics of the database server.
  - Backends - displays a list of active database connections, allows to terminate a particular back-end.

 The tabs listed above can be opened by clicking on the `‚ûï` sign on the tabs panel.

### Query tab

The top area of the tab contains the SQL editor. The toolbar in the middle allows to run most frequently used actions such as running the whole query or its selected part, formatting SQL code, import/export SQL code from files etc. The bottom part of the screen contains the query result data-grid and query plan visualizer (only available for Postgresl).

![Query tab overview](./images/query_tab-overview.png)

#### Editing the code
The query editor suports syntax highlighting code completion, code folding and formatting for most common SQL dialects.  

The code completion operates in live mode by default, providing suggestions as you type. Live completion may be disabled for the current database connection by toggling the `AB` switch on top of the Database Tree. The autocomplete can also be called with a hotkey (`Ctrl-Space`  or `Cmd-Space` by default).

The code can be auto-formatted either clicking the the **Format SQL** button or with a hotkey (`Alt-S` by default)

>üí° The script in the editor can be saved to a file or loaded from file using the **Save To file** and **Load From File** buttons on the toolbar.  
>üí° SQL scripts can also be imported by draggine the file to the editor

#### Running the query
The query can be executed by clicking the `‚ñ∂` (Run) button on the toolbar.
The `[‚ñ∂Ô∏é]` (Run Selection) button allows to execute the selected part of the code in the query editor, if no code is selected the code line where the cursor is will be executed. Alternatively, the selected region of the code can be executed via context menu of the editor.

Once query is executed its output will be displayed in the query results data-grid. Query results with more than 50 rows, are loaded in chunks, click `Fetch More` or `Fetch All` respectively to load the next chunk or complete query result; the number of next rows to be fetched can be selected from the drop-down list. 

Query errors returned by the database will be shown as red annotations to the left of the query line which caused error. Hover the mouse pointer over annotation to reveal error details.

#### Working with query results
The contents of query results data grid can be copied to clipboard. First, select the rows, cells or a region of the grid, then right-click on the selection and choose the corresponding option of the context menu.  

>üí° whole rows or columns can be selected  by clickin on the row number or the column name respectively

![Query result copy](./images/query-result-copy.png)

The contents an individual data-grid cell can be viewed in a pop-up window. This is especially useful with cells containing large amounts of data. To view the contents of the cell either double-click on it or select the `View Content` option of its context menu.  

The query result data can be exported to a file by selecting the desired export format in the drop-down (XLSX CSV or JSON) and clicking the `üì•`(Export Data) button.

>üí° Data-grid columns can be quickly maximized/minimized by double-clicking the corresponding column header.  
>üí° Hover over the data-grid header to reveal column resize controls.  
>üí° Click on the `‚ãÆ` to the left of data-grid header to reveal grid layout menu  


#### Re-running previous queries
PgManage keeps the history of previously executed queries. The history can be searched and filtered by date range and the database against which query was executed.  

![Image showing the query history](./images/history.png)

Click the `Query History` button to bring up the history modal.  
Right-click on the cell of **Command** column of the history record and select the `Copy Content to Query Tab` context menu option. Alternatively, just double click on the particular cell of the Command column.

#### Visualizing the query execution plan
The query execution plan visualizer can be called by switching to the explain link of the query tab. To run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` click on the corresponding button on the toolbar. Alternatively the query can be prepended by `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` keywords and executed. 
  
![Query tab with the explain tree under it](./images/query_tab_explain.png)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The Explain functionality is available for PostgreSQL only.


### Console tab

The database console behaves similarly to native database console tools like psql etc. and may be used in scenarios where more "direct" database access is desired.

![Console tab with a text editor under it](./images/console.png)

### Monitoring dashboard

The monitoring dashboard displays various database performance metrics in form of graph/chart/grid widgets.

## Backup and Restore

PgManage has a convenient user interface for Postgres's [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html), [pg_dumpall](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-dumpall.html), and [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) set of commands.  

These features can be accessed by selectin **Backup** or **Restore** options from the DB tree context menu of Server Schema or Table nodes.  

The backup and restore operations run as background jobs, allowing to do other tasks in PgManage without interrupting the process. Once the job completes the notification will be shown.

The backup/restore operations are listed under the `Jobs` section. Here, information such as PID, Type, Server, Object, Start Time, Status, Duration, and Actions will be displayed.

Under the `Actions` column, you may view details about a specific job or delete the job. The information about the job will contain the executed command, the start time, the duration of execution, and the output. The output of currently executing jobs can be viewed live by clicking its View Details icon.


### PIGZ Support
A more performant PIGZ backup compressor is supported on Linux. If desired, PIGZ needs to be installed on the target OS. For example, in Ubuntu, you may install it as follows:

```
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y pigz
```
Next, the path to the PIGZ binaries needs to be specified in `Utilities Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Pigz Binary Path`.

![Settings menu with the PIGZ's path field](./images/settings_options.png)

Once installed, toggle Compress with Pigz or Decompress with Pigz switch on the backup/restore screens respectively.

### Backup

PgManage allows you to create backups for a database, a table or the whole server. Database backups can be made in`custom`, `.tar`, `plain`, or `directory` formats. The only format supported for server backups is `plain`.

To create a backup, right-click on the server, database or a table node of the DB entity tree. Then, select `Backup Server` or `Backup` respectively. This will open the following tab:

![Image of the backup dialog and the Job section](./images/bk-jobs.png)

Once the general information is filled out the `Revert settings`, `Preview`, and `Backup` buttons will be made available.
- **Revert settings:** resets the backup dialog settings to their default.
- **Preview:** displays a modal with the command to be executed.
- **Backup:** executes the backup commands as indicated in the form.

### Restore

To restore the server or a database, right-click on the appropriate object on the DB entity tree and select `Restore Server` or `Restore` respectively. A new tab will open with the restore dialog.

![Image of the restore dialog and the Job section](./images/restore.png)

Once the general information is filled out the `Revert Settings`, `Preview`, and `Backup` buttons will be made available.
- **Revert settings:** resets the restore dialog settings to their default.
- **Preview:** displays a modal with the command to be executed.
- **Restore:** executes the restore commands as indicated in the form.

## pg_cron GUI Instructions

First, install pg_cron extension in your target OS. For example, in Ubuntu, you may install it as follows:

```
sudo apt-get -y install postgresql-[postgres version]-cron
```

Next, add pg_cron to `shared_preload_libraries` in server configuratiom management moule:

![PG Cron in shared preload librarues](./images/pg_cron_shared_preload.png)

Reload postgres configuration to apply the changes:

```
sudo pg_ctlcluster [version] [cluster_name] reload
```
Then, the pg_cron functions and metadata tables can be created.

Add *pg_cron* extension via Extension Manager:  \
![PG Cron add extension](./images/pg_cron_add_extension.png)

Now the new `Jobs` item should be available under the database node:
![PG Cron Jobs Node](./images/pg_cron_jobs_node.png)

A new job can be created by right clicking the `Jobs` node, existing jobs can be edited by selecting the ``View/Edit`` option from the job context menu.
In the Job dialog the following options are available:
- **Job Name**
- **Run In Database**: the database against which run the query
- **Run At/Cron expression**: the period for running the job. You can use the Cron schedule widget to define the schedule or click the ``Define manually`` switch and write Cron expression by hand.
- **Command to Run**: the SQL expression to be executed at the specified schedule

When viewing the existing job, the ``Job Statistics`` tab can be used to view last 50 job execution results.

![PG Cron UI dialog](./images/pg_cron_modal.png)

**Important:** By default, pg_cron uses libpq to open a new connection to the local database, which needs to be allowed by pg_hba.conf. It may be necessary to enable trust authentication for connections coming from localhost in for the user running the cron job, or you can add the password to a .pgpass file, which libpq will use when opening a connection. \
Please refer to [official pg_cron documentation](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron#ensuring-pg_cron-can-start-jobs) for more details.
