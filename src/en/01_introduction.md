# Introduction

![PgManage application](./images/intro.png)

PgManage is a modern Open-Source Database Client application. This application provides an easy-to-use environment for querying and administrating multiple DBMS distributions – such as PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB, and Oracle.

Though now dormant, the [OmniDB](https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB) project provided important underlying work for the expansions done on PgManage. OmniDB was a lightweight, browser-based application that supported PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, and SQLite. PgManage continues OmniDB’s legacy by providing a simple, unified interface to manage DBMS.

PgManage’s interface allows to quickly switch between database sessions through a connections sidebar. The application allows to run queries, monitor databases, and manage PostgreSQL server configuration, among other features. Though the project is currently focused on database management, features for developers are being planned as the project progresses.
