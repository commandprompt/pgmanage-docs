## Credits

- We proudly leverage all of the great work done by the original (now dormant) project [OmniDB](https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB)
- Postgres query plan visualization is powered by [Dalibo Postgres Explain Visualizer 2](https://github.com/dalibo/pev2)
- Though now dormant, the [OmniDB](https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB) project provided important underlying work for the expansions done on PgManage. OmniDB was a lightweight, browser-based application that supported PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, and SQLite. PgManage continues OmniDBâ€™s legacy by providing a simple, unified interface to manage DBMS.
